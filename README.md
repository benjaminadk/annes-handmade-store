# Anne's Handmade

Anne's Handmade is an ecommerce site designed as the client facing portion of a platform for my mother (Anne) to sell
her jewelry online.

This site along with Anne's Admin combine to make a full ecommerce application. Anne's Handmade offers users the chance to
purchase goods as a guest or as a logged in user. I felt like the more I streamlined the point of sale, the better results I
would see.
