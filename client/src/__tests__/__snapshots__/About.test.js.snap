        I started beading several years ago. I was a Store Manager in a fast paced retail environment with several Assistants and 70 - 90 Associates working under me. I was stressed and anxious and working hard to meet my goals and deadlines.

        I discovered a neighborhood bead store in which I found an escape from my work world on days off. It was a peaceful and creative place. I was a novice and needed a lot of advice and encouragement. I made simple things at first, mostly earrings, which I sold and donated the money to

        Now I am retired and have time on my hands to devote to a business venture. My sister Susan was a big fan of my jewelry. I recently lost her to a violent crime. Susan was a juvenile diabetic from age 2 and was an RN who worked as a diabetic educator for many years. If I am successful with Anne's Handmade I will donate 5% of my net profits to

        Most of my beaded pieces are "one of a kind". I enjoy working with Swolvorski crystal beads and also with many of the Quartz gemstones like Aventurine, Carnelion, Amethyst, Pink Quartz, Jaspers and Onyx. Most of the charms and hardware I use are sterling silver. Most of the gemstones are thought to have healing or spiritual qualities.
